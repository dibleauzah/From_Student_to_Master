# New Name (2024+): From Student to Master

__ Old Name: Final-Public-2023

__Old Goal (2023):
I really hope this directory will be my last purely learning-purpose directory. Regardless, that--learning--is its purpose. Thanks for visiting!

__New Goal (2024+):
"Simple," really. To go from coding and data-sci student, to Master! And yes, I know it's somewhat "over-ambitious." But I am also certain that it is possible!
